I'll be honest; I’m not a coder. I know you deal with much more complex logic every day, but I wanted to try my hand at it because I know it’s something you like. I hope you like it 🫣
When something goes wrong in the code, we don't just throw the whole computer away — we find the bug, we fix the code, and we restart the system. 

Consider this my **System Reboot** 🥹 

I’m sorry for being so immature and not being sensitive. I value this more than a "misunderstanding" should allow. I hope you can forgive me and we can start from scratch.
