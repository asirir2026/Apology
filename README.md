### Project: Clearing the Fog

I'll be honest; I’m not a coder. I know you deal with much more complex logic every day, but I wanted to try my hand at it because I know it’s something you like. I hope you like it 🫣

### The Logic:
In programming, when something goes wrong, we don't just throw the whole computer away—we find the bug, we fix the code, and we restart the system. 

Consider this my **System Restart**. 

I’m sorry for being rude, judgemental and insensitive. I value this more than a "misunderstanding" should allow. I hope we can clear the fog and start from scratch.
